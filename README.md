# Book Data Analysis
A Python-based data analytics project exploring a dataset of 2,000+ books. This project focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and finding key insights.

# Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Missingno)

Jupyter Notebook

# Key Processes
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, formatted numeric columns (pages, rating), and filtered publication years (1950-2025).

EDA: Analyzed distribution of books and identified publication trends.

Visualization: Used missingno for data integrity checks and Seaborn for trend analysis.

# Quick Insight
The dataset contains 2,049 records.

The highest number of books in this dataset was published in 2010.
